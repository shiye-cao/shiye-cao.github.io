I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University. I am a member of the [Intuitive Computing Laboratory](https://intuitivecomputing.github.io/), which is affiliated with the [Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare](https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/) and [Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics](https://lcsr.jhu.edu/). I am advised by [Dr. Chien-Ming Huang](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/) and [Dr. Anqi Liu](https://anqiliu-ai.github.io/).

My research aims to develop social robots capable of providing long-term, personalized support for people. Toward this goal, I enhance the social capabilities of robots to more closely emulate natural human-human interactions and empower stakeholders (i.e., caregivers) to co-design contextually relevant, personalized, and meaningful interactions. To evaluate the real-world effectiveness of social robots as long-term supports, I design, develop, and deploy social robots in the homes of preschool children to foster early language development. Through these long-term, in-home deployments, I investigate how robots can sustain engagement, personalize their behaviors, and integrate into family routines to meaningfully support early language development in children with diverse needs and capabilities.
